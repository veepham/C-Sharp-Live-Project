# C# Live Project

## Background
This project was built using ASP .NET MVC and Entity Framework to create an interactive website for managing the content and productions for a theater/acting company. During the two-week sprint, I worked with my peers to contribute to building a content management service for users to easily manage what displays in their website.

For my contributions, I worked on creating and displaying the database of blog authors for the website by creating a BlogAuthor model and scaffolding CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) pages for this model. Next, I worked on each of these pages to display uniformity and meet the design expectations of the client. This project touched on many skills, allowing me to apply the principles of MVC design pattern using the Entity Framework. I was expected to be able to work with the Package Manager Console to set up and update my NuGet Packages and database and with Chrome Developer Tools to help debug CSS and test HTML. This project also relied heavily proficiency in Razor syntax.

During this two-week sprint, I was able to apply Agile/Scrum methodology and become more comfortable working in Azure DevOps. With my peers working on different parts of the website, I felt confident creating branches, merging updates from the master branch, resolving branch conflicts, and creating pull requests to maintain clean version control.
